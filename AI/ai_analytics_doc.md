By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, Ma's Tacos can transform raw data into actionable insights, enhance customer engagement, optimize operations, and increase profitability.

## Key Analytics Objectives

1. **Customer Behavior Analysis**
2. **Menu Performance Optimization**
3. **Operational Efficiency**
4. **Marketing Campaign Effectiveness**
5. **Predictive Analytics for Business Planning**

## AI-Powered Analytics Implementation

### 1. Data Collection & Processing Framework

#### Data Sources
- **Transaction Data**: Orders, payments, and menu item selections
- **Customer Data**: Demographics, loyalty points, reservation history
- **Operational Data**: Peak hours, table utilization, order fulfillment times
- **Customer Feedback**: Survey responses and ratings
- **Marketing Data**: Campaign engagement and conversion rates

#### AI-Enhanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Implement automated data extraction from MySQL database
- Use AI for data cleaning and normalization
- Create data pipelines for regular analytics updates
- Establish real-time data streaming for dashboard updates

### 2. Customer Analytics Platform

#### Customer Segmentation
- **AI Implementation**: Use clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering) to identify distinct customer segments based on:
  - Ordering patterns
  - Visit frequency
  - Average spend
  - Menu preferences
  - Response to promotions

```python
# Example clustering code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="username",
    password="password",
    database="mas_tacos"
)

# Query customer data
query = """
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.LoyaltyPoints, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderId) AS OrderCount,
    AVG(o.TotalAmount) AS AvgSpend,
    MAX(o.OrderTime) AS LastOrderDate
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
"""
customer_data = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Prepare data for clustering
X = customer_data[['LoyaltyPoints', 'OrderCount', 'AvgSpend']]
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

# Apply K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
customer_data['Segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Analyze segments
segment_profiles = customer_data.groupby('Segment').agg({
    'LoyaltyPoints': 'mean',
    'OrderCount': 'mean',
    'AvgSpend': 'mean',
    'CustomerId': 'count'
}).rename(columns={'CustomerId': 'Count'})
```

#### Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
- **AI Implementation**: Develop ML regression models to predict future value of customers
- **Business Impact**: Identify high-value customers for personalized retention strategies

#### Churn Prediction
- **AI Implementation**: Classification algorithms to identify at-risk customers
- **Business Impact**: Enable proactive retention campaigns before customers leave

### 3. Menu Analytics & Optimization

#### Menu Item Performance Analysis
- **AI Implementation**: Association rule mining to identify item combinations frequently ordered together
- **Business Impact**: Create effective combo deals and menu layouts

```python
# Example association rule mining
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# Query order items data
query = """
SELECT o.OrderId, oi.MenuItemId
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderId = oi.OrderId
"""
order_items = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Convert to basket format
basket = order_items.pivot_table(index='OrderId', columns='MenuItemId', aggfunc=lambda x: 1, fill_value=0)

# Apply Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(basket, min_support=0.05, use_colnames=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1.5)

# Find strong associations
strong_rules = rules[rules['lift'] > 2]
```

#### Price Elasticity Analysis
- **AI Implementation**: Statistical models to determine optimal price points
- **Business Impact**: Maximize revenue without decreasing demand

#### Menu Recommendation Engine
- **AI Implementation**: Collaborative filtering for personalized menu suggestions
- **Business Impact**: Increase average order value through targeted upselling

### 4. Operational Intelligence

#### Demand Forecasting
- **AI Implementation**: Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict customer volume
- **Business Impact**: Optimize staffing levels and inventory management

```python
# Example demand forecasting
from prophet import Prophet

# Query historical customer volume
query = """
SELECT DATE(OrderTime) as date, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY DATE(OrderTime)
ORDER BY date
"""
daily_orders = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
daily_orders.columns = ['ds', 'y']  # Prophet requires these column names

# Create and fit model
model = Prophet(seasonality_mode='multiplicative')
model.fit(daily_orders)

# Make future predictions
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)  # 30 days forecast
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot forecast
fig = model.plot(forecast)
```

#### Table Utilization Optimization
- **AI Implementation**: Optimize reservation time slots based on historical patterns
- **Business Impact**: Maximize seating capacity and revenue

#### Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback
- **AI Implementation**: NLP models to extract sentiment and topics from survey responses
- **Business Impact**: Identify areas for improvement and measure impact of changes

### 5. Marketing Campaign Analytics

#### Campaign Effectiveness Prediction
- **AI Implementation**: Predictive models to estimate ROI of marketing campaigns
- **Business Impact**: Allocate marketing budget to highest-performing channels

#### Personalized Marketing Automation
